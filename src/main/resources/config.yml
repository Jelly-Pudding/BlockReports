# BlockReports Configuration
# Prevents chat reporting by stripping message signatures and enforcing server-side protection.

# Strip chat signatures from outgoing chat packets
# This converts signed player chat messages to unsigned system messages
# preventing chat reporting while maintaining chat functionality
strip-chat-signatures: true

# Hide the "secure chat" warning popup that appears to clients
# This modifies server data packets to prevent the warning from showing
hide-secure-chat-warning: true

# Show a message to players when they join explaining that chat reporting is disabled
show-join-message: true

# The message shown to players when they join (supports MiniMessage format)
# See https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html for formatting options
join-message: "<gray>[BlockReports] Chat reporting is disabled on this server"

# Prefix used in all plugin messages (supports MiniMessage format)

# ============================================================================
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# ============================================================================
# 
# This plugin uses PacketEvents to intercept and modify chat packets at the
# protocol level for maximum effectiveness. It:
#
# 1. Converts signed player chat messages to unsigned system messages
# 2. Cancels chat header packets that contain signature metadata  
# 3. Modifies server data to hide secure chat warnings
#
# This provides comprehensive protection against chat reporting without
# requiring server.properties changes, though setting 
# enforce-secure-profile=false is still recommended.
